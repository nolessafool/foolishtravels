Coffee then breakfast
Packed up and didn't forget my fridge pizza
Straight east outta Fresno - nicer on a Sunday
Tangerine Lady 
Thousands of plants per orchard, sometimes more than 100k
Fall grapes from yesterday
Nuts and olives still to come 
Flirted with foothills yesterday kissed today
What does it say on the hillside just south of Reed and Anna dale? (Check Google satellite)
Fell over in reedley
Next 40 miles ran together 
Stopped for leftover pizza at some point
Surprise mile 80 climb
Sunset atop the ridge
Biked into Sandy in the deepening dusk 
With dinner
