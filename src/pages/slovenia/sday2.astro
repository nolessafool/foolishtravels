Our second day was a rest day, and we weren't sad to spend the morning cooking, eating, and hanging out in the warm lodge, since it was under 40 and rainy when we woke up after a long night's sleep in the warm tiny cabin we chose over our tents.  Breakfast was oatmeal and coffee and brunch was a couple beers we'd carried from yesterday's visit to Rooster brewery, before we headed into town for lunch.
<p>
I had thought we were coming back to camp (1.7mi but up a big hill) before I was going to set out on solo adventuring, so I hadn't gotten ready for my planned 40 mile ride but then Jeff said I didn't need to come back right as we were ready to leave, so I hurried to get my kit (extra warmth, snacks, repair tools, bike computer with latest planned route loaded into it) all together while Jeff stood in the rain moderately impatiently.  Having collected myself, we bombed into town and I had the "workman's lunch special" beef goulash and helped Jeff finish his pizza.
<p>
I had used RidewithGPS' heatmaps to design a loop past some interesting looking national parks - to see a disappearing lake and a natural bridge.  But, both features were 15mi or so away so the first 15mi was just "riding where most people ride" to get over there.  And indeed I did see a few large groups of roadies - 8 to 15 spandex folks - on various parts of my route, including the worst highway-ish roads right at rush hour near Cerknica.  So, people do ride these narrow trafficky roads, but I was glad for the e-bike at full assist and still ended up pulling off a few times to let traffic past.  Fortunately I was pulled off when a roadie train of 15 going uphill went past me in the opposite direction, because despite 70kph speed limit, that road was barely wide enough for 2 cars, and couldn't have handled them + me + 1 car passing between us!  But that was the most sketchy part and 90+% was quiet country lanes, dirt roads, and villages, with a bit of cyclepath thrown in for good measure.
<p> 
Once through Cerknica on my way out, it was mostly dirt around the lake, where I took some pictures and hiked down to the shore to see a spring-in-a-cave (from a fair distance, since the cave entrance was well underwater.  I could have borrowed a boat to go in, I guess, but I was pretty much all alone out there and the boats were clearly privately owned...).  The dirt road around the lake hit the dirt road to the natural bridge so I veered off and was absolutely alone for the 5mi or so to the bridge and back to the highway into Cerknica.  It was cool but it was several hundred feet below the roadway and the trail to get very close was pretty sketchy and lonely so I satisfied myself with some pictures from the top and carried on back through town.
<p>
Enjoyed the last 10 mi back to the campground since that was all very traffic-quiet and I just had the bike on full assist so went pretty fast up a reasonably large climb without breaking a sweat.
<p>
Gonna get cleaned up (it was a bit muddy out, though never hard to ride levels of squish) before heading back into town for dinner.
